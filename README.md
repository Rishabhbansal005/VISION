# VISION

**VISION** is a web application specially designed for people who are visually impaired. It provides full voice-based control to help users perform tasks easily without needing to touch the screen.

## 🧠 How It Works

When the web app is opened, it greets the user by saying:

> "Hey, I am Vision. What would you like me to do today?"

The user can then give voice commands. For example, if the user says:

> "Hey Vision, who is in front of me?"

The app will redirect to the **Person Detection** page and start detecting people using the camera.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS** – For the user interface and design
- **JavaScript (Web Speech API)** – For voice command features
- **OpenCV (via Python backend)** – For real-time person detection
- **Python (Flask or similar)** – For backend support and integration
- And many more useful technologies!
